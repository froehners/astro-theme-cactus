# Background
Cityblock is a value-based healthcare company that’s focused on the Medicaid and dually eligible population. They serve those with the most complex needs, and often with the least resources, in the way they deserve to be treated—with respect, compassion, dignity, and time.

## Problems
- Cityblock members do not know that they have Cityblock’s coverage and need to be contacted and onboarded (“outreach” and “consented”). 
    - Our members may be distrustful of us; we're often starting at zero with them. 
- Cityblock was rapidly scaling, and scaling across markets. The outreach team struggled with a manual and complex onboarding process. 
    - Each market did things a little differently. All the differences needed to be taken ito account and operationalized. 
    - They needed to decrease the time it took to onboard a member *and* reduce the time it took to train an outreach specialist (OS), no matter their location.
    - OS leads needed more visibility into the work
- Outreach had a workflow, but it was not integrated into Commons (Cityblock’s care system). They used too many tools to keep track of and had to duplicate work to hand-off a member. 
    - Commons is a healthcare platform, where the care team manages their members. The outreach team used it, but it wasn't built for their purposes.

## Goals 
**Meaningfully improve the efficiency of our engagement funnel**  
Enable outreach specialists to spend less time researching and more on personalized conversations. Provide a guided workflow so that the team doesn’t have to remember each step, reducing documentation gaps, and increasing documentation quality. 

**Personalize outreach conversations to offer more value upfront**  
Surface details about a member and scripts, tips, and resources that will help the outreach team with the initial engagement conversation. Provide a space to operationalize early wins and other engagement experiments. 

**Support a centralized outreach team**  
Simplify workflows for outreach specialists, allow new employees to get up to speed faster, and minimize nuances across markets. 

**KPIs**  
- Increase conversion rate (specifically our highest need members)
- Increase call volume
- Reduce time spent on research
- Adoption (this one's important - working outside of Commons is less safe, but also means we can’t learn as much from their usage)

## Feature Prioritization
1. **Validate and streamline workflows with Stakeholders** - what work is actually necessary, what can be simplified across markets. Stakeholders didn't know all the complexity across markets and workflows. We aligned on the outreach needs. They were close to the existing flow, but we agreed to do less manual tracking wherever possible.
2. **Where are the biggest inefficiencies?** Double documentation and documenting after the call were top of mind. Also all of the different tabs and clicking within Commons.
3. **How can we get better data while reducing user effort?** New KPIs: # of tabs open and # of Sheets/market. 
4. **Work with Eng partner (Dan) to find the easy wins** - He wrote a script to duplicate the notes so Commons still worked, but the user could do half the work. We did this before actually building a proper fix so we can immediately reduce the work and build a little trust with the OSs. 
5. **Rank features by asking the OS’s,** “What is the worst part of your job?” Attitude impacts the outreach success, so the better moods we can get the OSs in, the more effective they'll be. (Also, it's a nice thing to do)

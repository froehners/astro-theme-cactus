# Background

The Outreach page is the new foundation for Cityblock's outreach process, improving outreach consistency and efficiency for the team. The Outreach page helps the Outreach team know how to talk to each member, gather important information, and suggests effective ways to engage with a member, based on their needs. By providing personalized help to the outreach team during their interactions, we can save time on research, experiment and scale different outreach approaches, and make the outreach process smoother for both the team and the people they're reaching out to. 

## Goals 

The Outreach hub needs to connect with existing prioritization tools and relevant data sources (claims, electronic health records, pharmacy data, social care and entitlements, etc.) and to our internal outreach model (which includes data like mode of outreach, time of day, and likelihood to consent). It should drive next-steps for any team member to pick up and handoff a new member.

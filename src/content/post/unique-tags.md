## This post is to test zod transform

If you open the file `src/content/post/unique-tags.md`, the tags array has a number of duplicate blog strings of various cases.

These are removed as part of the removeDupsAndLowercase function found in `src/content/config.ts`.

# Background

Broadly, our research has shown people want quizzes or recommendation wizards to narrow down the different legal services they may need.
For Intellectual Property (IP) LegalZoom has a simple 1-question Help me decide tool on the IP Category page. Testing participants would often be excited to see the CTA button, but found the actual experience and recommendations disappointing.
This work was done in concert with a case study project for Smashing Magazine Behavioral Design Workshop (highly recommended!)
